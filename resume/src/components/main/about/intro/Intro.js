      <p>
        I was graduated from Yıldız Technical Univercity Mechanical Engineering
        in 2013. After graduation l worked as engineer for many years, however
        meantime because of matlab lesson that l had in university l got
        interested in coding lesson eventually l decided to pursue my dreams
        thus l quit engineering and l wanted to open the door of the software
        world, it was not easy at the top to make desicion nevertheless now l am
        one the person who is coding the future though. The fact that the
        projects are done by team also encouraged me because I've always been a
        good team member. I have adopted the principle of continuous research,
        establishing strong communication with the environment and doing my work
        on the time. Since I am an engineer, I can look at problems more
        practically and solution-oriented, and this makes my work even easier.
